\begin{enumerate}
\item $AB$ is tangent to the circles $CAMN$ and $NMBD$. $M$ lies between $C$ and $D$ on the line $CD$, and $CD$ is parallel to $AB$. The chords $NA$ and $CM$ meet at $P$; the chords $NB$ and $MD$ meet at $Q$. The rays $CA$ and $DB$ meet at $E$. Prove that $PE = QE$.\hfill(IMO 2000)
