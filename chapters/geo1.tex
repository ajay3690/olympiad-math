    \item Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals. If $AB = 20$, $BC = 70$, and $CD = 90$, then what is the value of $DA$?\hfill(PRERMO 2014)
    \item In a triangle with integer side lengths, one side is three times as long as a second side, and the length of the third side is $17$. What is the greatest possible perimeter of the triangle?\hfill(PRERMO 2014)
    \item In a triangle $ABC$, $X$ and $Y$ are points on the segments $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, such that $ AX : XB = 1 : 2 $ and $ AY : YC = 2 : 1.$If the area of triangle $AXY$ is $10$, then what is the area of triangle $ABC$?\hfill(PRERMO 2014)
    \item Let $XOY$ be a triangle with $\angle XOY = 90\degree$. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of legs $OX$ and $OY$, respectively. Suppose that $XN = 19$ and $YM = 22$. What is $XY$?\hfill(PRERMO 2014)
