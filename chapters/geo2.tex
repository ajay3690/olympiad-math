\begin{enumerate}
\item $PS$ is a line segment of length 4 and $O$ is the midpoint of $PS$. A semicircular arc is drawn with $PS$ as diameter. Let $X$ be the midpoint of this arc. $Q$ and $R$ are points on the arc $PXS$ such that $QR$ is parallel to $PS$ and the semicircular arc drawn with $QR$ as diameter is tangent to $PS$. What is the area of the region $QXROQ$ bounded by the two semicircular arcs?\hfill(PRERMO 2012)
\item $O$ and $I$ are the circumcentre and incentre of $\triangle ABC$ respectively. Suppose $O$ lies in the interior of $\triangle ABC$ and $I$ lies on the circle passing through $B$, $O$, and $C$. What is the magnitude of $\angle BAC$ in degrees?\hfill(PRERMO 2012)
\item In $\triangle ABC$, we have $AC = BC = 7$ and $AB = 2$. Suppose that $D$ is a point on line $AB$ such that $B$ lies between $A$ and $D$ and $CD = 8$. What is the length of the segment $BD$?\hfill(PRERMO 2012)
\item In rectangle $ABCD$, $AB = 5$ and $BC = 3$. Points $F$ and $G$ are on line segment $CD$ so that $DF = 1$ and $GC = 2$. Lines $AF$ and $BG$ intersect at $E$. What is the area of $\triangle ABE$?\hfill(PRERMO 2012)
\item A triangle with perimeter 7 has integer side lengths. What is the maximum possible area of such a triangle?\hfill(PRERMO 2012)
\item $ABCD$ is a square and $AB$ = 1 Equilateral triangles $AYB$ and $CXD$ are drawn such that $X$ and $Y$ are inside the square.What is the length of $XY$?\hfill(PRERMO 2012)
