  \item Suppose $G$ is a connected graph with $k$ edges. Prove that it is possible to label the edges $1,2.....k$ in such a way that at each vertex which belongs to two or more edges, the greatest common divisor of the integers labeling those edges is equal to $1$.
	  $[$ A graph consists of a set of points, called vertices, together with a set of edges joining certain pairs of distinct vertices. Each pair of vertices. $u, v$ belongs to at most one edge. The graph $G$ is connected if for cach pair of distinct vertices $x, y$ there is some sequence of vertices   $x=v_0,v_1,v_2,.......,v_m = y$  such that each pair $v_i,v_{i+1}\brak{0\leq i < m}$ is joined by an edge of G$.]$ \hfill(IMO 1991)
